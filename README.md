# Tweet harvester
Python script to scrape, collect, and/or harvest tweets with the Twitter API V2 Academic Research Product Track. 

# Important note:
In order to be able to use this script you need a Twitter Developer's account. You can apply for this here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access. After approval, you will receive a "bearer token". You need to copy and paste this one in the script.

Also, all data will be stored in a local MySQL database. You need to set this up first. Alternatively, you can choose to save the data to a .csv file. However, a MySQL database is more stable.
